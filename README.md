## Overview
This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook lecture notes from the **Genomic Python** course. It includes concepts, Python code, and examples related to:
- Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Bioinformatics applications in Python
- Analyzing genomic data using Python libraries
- Writing scripts for biological data processing

Each notebook contains **Markdown explainations** + **live code examples** to reinforce learning and act as a study guide.
